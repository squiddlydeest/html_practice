    <p> GIFs are good for animations, but are limited in their color palette</p>

    <p>PNG files are ideal for anything that is neither animated nor is a photo</p>

    <p> SVG images are vector-based, and thus can scale up and down to any
        dimension without a loss in quality, this makes them ideal for images
        with <em>responsive</em> design! They accomplish the same goals as a 
        PNG image as well, so they should be used whenever possible(i.e. when 
        not using an actual photo or animations)

    <p>There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently 
      across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using 
      your image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch). If your images contain
      a lot of text, this can have a big impact on file size. </p>

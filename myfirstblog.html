        <h1> Day One(Sunday)</h1>
        <p> Woke up very anxious, knowing it would be a long day. <strong> praying </strong> no one would 
            show up at all through the day. Lo and behold, customer already at the door at <em> 10:59 am</em>. </p>
        <p> My energy levels were <strong> super low </strong> throughout the day but people did not stop. I got pretty lucky that
             for the most part there was never more than one or two people waiting for help at a time but it didn't make it better. </p>

        <p><h4><strong><em> The jets sucked. </em></strong></h4> </p>

        <p>My one saving grace was that I didn't run into <strong>TOO</strong> many issues with OMNI or RQ throughout the day.</p>

            <p><em>425 with 5 new lines ain't too bad though ;)</em></p>
